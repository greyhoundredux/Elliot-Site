						<p>I'm entirely self-taught in HTML and CSS. I decided one day to create a website for myself, and after playing around and seeing what simple HTML and CSS was capable of, I became hooked. I love finding new and exciting functionality, and I'd love to learn more and refine my skills in a professional environment.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="javascript" class="skill-descriptor" style="display: none;">
						<img src="pics/js.png" alt="JavaScript logo">
						<p>After learning the basics of HTML, I quickly learned that in order to create websites with exciting and unique functionality, I'd need to look into JavaScript. I love how meta JavaScript feels, and how there exists infinite possibilities for cool features. I'm excited by the prospect of digging deeper into JavaScript to create webpages bubbling with life and creativity.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="java" class="skill-descriptor" style="display: none;">
						<img src="pics/java.png" alt="Java logo">
						<p>Coding in Java made up the main body of my Software Engineering module at Bath Uni. We were tasked with creating a game using Java, which we did successfully and acheived a high merit grade. The formal education in Object Oriented Programming has proven to be invaluable for my self taught endeavours.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="python" class="skill-descriptor" style="display: none;">
						<img src="pics/python.png" alt="Python logo">
						<p>I've used Python at Bath Uni during the Artificial Intelligence module. It was used to write scripts for problem solving, for example I've written one script that solves a sudoku, and another demonstrating the Naive Bayes Classifier.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="c" class="skill-descriptor" style="display: none;">
						<img src="pics/c.png" alt="C logo">
						<p>I was taught C as my first programming language at Bath Uni. We used it to cover the initial Principles of Programming module, as it makes for a nice entry level language. Again, I achieved a merit in this module.</p>

					<p id="language-line">...and I'm 100% looking to learn more</p>
