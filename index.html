		<div id="html" class="skill-descriptor" style="display: none;">
			<p>I'm entirely self-taught in HTML and CSS. I decided one day to create a website for myself, and after playing around and seeing what simple HTML and CSS was capable of, I became hooked. I love finding new and exciting functionality, and I'd love to learn more and refine my skills in a professional environment.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="javascript" class="skill-descriptor" style="display: none;">
			<p>After learning the basics of HTML, I quickly learned that in order to create websites with more functionality, I'd need to look into JavaScript. I love how meta JavaScript feels, and how there is infinite possibilities for cool features.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="java" class="skill-descriptor" style="display: none;">
			<p>Coding in Java made up the main body of my Software Engineering module whilst studying Computer Science at Bath Uni. We were tasked with creating a game using Java, which we did successfully and acheived a high merit grade.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="python" class="skill-descriptor" style="display: none;">
			<p>I've used Python at Bath Uni during the Artificial Intelligence module. It was used to write scripts for problem solving, for example I've written one script that solves a sudoku, and another demonstrating the Naive Bayes Classifier.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="c" class="skill-descriptor" style="display: none;">
			<p></p>I was taught C as my first programming language at Bath Uni. We used it to cover the initial Principles of Programming module, as it makes for a nice entry level language. Again, I achieved a merit in this module.</p>

		<p id="language-line">...and I'm 100% looking to learn more</p>
